1. Create a notebook in the [Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/) and make it public.
    * In the cloud UI, use the New Notebook button and then use the Share dialog to make it public.
    * From the [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/), you could publish notebook content like so:

        ```wl
        CloudPublish[Manipulate[Plot[Sin[a x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}], {a, 1, 3}]]
        ```
2. Install this library in your JavaScript project using

    ```bash
    npm install wolfram-notebook-embedder
    ```
        
    so you can import it in JavaScript as
    
    ```js
    import * as WolframNotebookEmbedder from 'wolfram-notebook-embedder';
    ```
        
    or import it as a `<script>` tag from a CDN:
    
    ```html
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/wolfram-notebook-embedder@0.3/dist/wolfram-notebook-embedder.min.js"></script>
    ```
3. In your HTML, create a container where you want the notebook to be rendered (say `<div id="notebookContainer"></div>`) and add the following JavaScript code:

    ```js
    var embedding = WolframNotebookEmbedder.embed('url', document.getElementById('notebookContainer'));
    ```
    
    where `url` is the URL of your cloud object from step 1. More details about `embed` are described in the [library interface documentation](./LibraryInterface.md).
4. If you want to control the notebook from your JavaScript code, wait for the `embed` result (a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)) to resolve, and then use various [notebook API methods](./NotebookAPI.md):

    ```js
    embedding.then(function (nb) {
        // This will reset the DynamicModule variable x$$
        // in the first cell of the notebook.
        return nb.getCells().then(function (cells) {
            nb.setDynamicModuleVariable({
                cellId: cells[0].id,
                name: 'x$$',
                value: 0
            });
        });
    })
    ```
5. If you want to serve static HTML from your server so the notebook can be rendered before JavaScript code is loaded (which also helps with SEO), take a look at [server-side rendering](./ServerSideRendering.md).
6. If you run into any issues, take a look at the [troubleshooting guide](./Troubleshooting.md). If you think you found a bug, please report it.
